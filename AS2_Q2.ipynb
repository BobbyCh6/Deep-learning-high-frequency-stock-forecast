In other words, this scaling parameter can make the high probability events more probable and low probability events less probable. Using the scaling parameter to adjust the multinomial distribution is a more proper way to sample than both greedy selection which is deterministic and not empirically good, and selecting directly from multinomial distribution which may be too random.\n",
        "\n",
        "The result shows that, when the scaling parameter T is small, the prediction will have limited word scope, which means the output is the repetition of several words. With the increase of T, the word scope becomes larger, the output also makes more sense. When T equals 1.2, the output sentence seems \"readable\".\n",

        "The reason is that when T is small, the scaling effect on the multinomial distribution is strong, the temperature gives extra more weights to the character with higher probability."
